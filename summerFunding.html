    <h1>Institute for Practical Ethics in Public Life Summer Internship</h1>
    <p><strong>Amount: </strong>$2,000 (see below)</p>
    <p><strong>Number of Grants Available: </strong>15-20</p>
    <p><strong>Application Due: </strong>5:00 PM, Friday, December 8, 2017</p>
    <p><strong>Who It’s For: </strong>Not specified, recipients tell us mostly third years, a few second years</p>
    <p><strong>What’s Required: </strong>Those who receive awards will be expected to spend at least eight weeks in an internship (approved by the IPE), to meet with faculty at the IPE (and perhaps with other interns) to discuss aspects of their internship before it starts, to prepare, at the end of the summer, an 8-10 page narrative and analysis of the internship, with particular attention to questions and issues of ethics (broadly conceived), and to meet, in the fall semester, with other interns and Institute faculty to discuss their experiences.</p>
    <p><strong>Nature of Internship: </strong> Internships take a variety of forms:</p>
      <li>Research</li>
      <li>Service</li>
      <li>Learning</li>
      <li>Some combination of the above 3</li>
    <p><strong>Stipend: </strong></p>
    <p>The IPE will usually provide a stipend of $2,000.00 toward students’ internships. If the internship is unpaid, a larger stipend may be available in a few cases, depending on location, living arrangements, etc. If the internship receives financial support from other sources, the IPE stipend may be reduced in order to make the internships as equitable as possible. We will discuss specific financial arrangements with students after they have received notification of their awards and arranged their internships.</p>
