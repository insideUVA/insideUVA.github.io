    <h3>Summer Internship Funding</h3>
      <p> These grants are intended to support unpaid internships, often in public interest work where the organization can't afford to pay the intern. Stipends are often used to support students in paying for housing and other summer costs. Some of the grants require students to have an internship before applying, while others allow students to apply with an idea of what they want to do. Please let us know if you find other opportunities! Email us at tips@insideuva.io.</p>

        <h2>Institute for Practical Ethics Summer Internship</h2>
        <p><strong>Amount: </strong>$2,000 (see below)</p>
        <p><strong>Number of Grants Available: </strong>15-20</p>
        <p><strong>Application Due: </strong>5:00 PM, Friday, December 8, 2017</p>
        <p><strong>Who It’s For: </strong>Not specified, recipients tell us mostly third years, a few second years, and in special cases, first years</p>
        <p><strong>What’s Required: </strong>Those who receive awards will be expected to spend at least eight weeks in an internship (approved by the IPE), to meet with faculty at the IPE (and perhaps with other interns) to discuss aspects of their internship before it starts, to prepare, at the end of the summer, an 8-10 page narrative and analysis of the internship, with particular attention to questions and issues of ethics (broadly conceived), and to meet, in the fall semester, with other interns and Institute faculty to discuss their experiences.</p>
        <p><strong>Nature of Internship: </strong> Internships take a variety of forms:</p>
          <li>Research</li>
          <li>Service</li>
          <li>Learning</li>
          <li>Some combination of the above 3</li>
        <p><strong>Stipend: </strong></p>
        <p>The IPE will usually provide a stipend of $2,000.00 toward students’ internships. If the internship is unpaid, a larger stipend may be available in a few cases, depending on location, living arrangements, etc. If the internship receives financial support from other sources, the IPE stipend may be reduced in order to make the internships as equitable as possible. We will discuss specific financial arrangements with students after they have received notification of their awards and arranged their internships.</p>
