  <h1>insideUVA</h1>
  <p>Welcome to our anarchy!</p>
  <h4>Why?</h4>
  <p>We want to democratize and information and opportunity at UVA. We started this project after becoming increasingly frustrated by the inaccessibility of information about opportunities on grounds outside certain bubbles. If you find new opportunity, keep us posted at secrets@insideuva.io.</p>
  <h4>PLEASE DON’T BE AN ASSHOLE</h4>
  <p>We ask that if you do get multiple grants, please tell the organizations and give back those you don’t need. These funding opportunities can mean a lot to students from lower income or single parent backgrounds who otherwise can’t afford to take unpaid internships or do summer research. If you already have funding available, or the monetary aspect of the grant is not important to you, please consider other students who depend on making money in the summers to support themselves during the year.</p>
