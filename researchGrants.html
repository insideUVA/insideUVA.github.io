        <p><strong>Amount: </strong>$6,000 for the pair of students</p>
        <p><strong>Number of Grants: </strong>15</p>
        <p><strong>Application Due: </strong>February, 12, 2018</p>
        <p><strong>Who It's For: </strong>The Double Hoo Research Grant supports pairs of undergraduate and graduate scholars seeking to pursue research together. The program is intended to encourage collaborative interaction between the undergraduate and graduate communities throughout the University.  These collaborations provide opportunities for more advanced research for undergraduates and valuable mentoring experiences for the graduate student. Awards of up to $6,000 are granted to undergraduate/graduate pairs to be shared between the two at their discretion and used within one year. Faculty advisors receive $500 in research support. Grant recipients make a progress report and a final report to the Center for Undergraduate Excellence, and they present their research at a spring gathering. Beginning in Spring 2016, the program will offer a renewal process for pairs that plan to continue their work.What’s Required: Applications must be submitted jointly by undergraduate-graduate student pairs.  The undergraduate may be a first- or second-year student at the time of application. Third- year applicants are limited to transfer students. The program focuses on first and second year undergraduate students with the purpose of creating an access point to research. This early entry point also allows for longer partnerships (see question #5). Graduate students must be enrolled in a doctoral program. All applicants must be full-time U.Va. students and must remain enrolled at the University through the completion of their project (i.e., spring of the year following application).  The Center welcomes proposals from all subject areas and schools at the University.</p>
