        <h1>Political and Social Thought</h1>

        <p><strong>Application Prerequisites: </strong>There are no formally listed prerequisites to apply for the major other than being enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences. Most applicants are in their second year of study at the University of Virginia. Furthermore, it is recommended that interested students take at least one <a href="http://pages.shanti.virginia.edu/pst/the-major/requirements/"> foundations courses</a> that would count toward the major.</p>
        <p><strong>Application Process: </strong>
          <ol style = "padding-left: 3%">
            <li>A completed PST application form.</li>
            <li>A letter of recommendation by a faculty member.</li>
            <li>A 300-500 word essay. This essay should address the following two questions: (1) Why are you interested in becoming a PST major? (2) At this (tentative) point, what three area studies would you select in constructing your PST curriculum? This answer does not obligate students to a particular course of studies if they are accepted into the program.</li>
            <li>A writing sample. Students may submit a previously completed term paper or essay (preferably with the instructor's comments on it) or a piece of creative writing.</li>
